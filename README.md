SQL Project 1 – Unveiling Customer Insights for Danny’s Diner

In the bustling city, amidst the aroma of delectable Japanese cuisine, there lies a charming little restaurant known as Danny’s Diner. It is the brainchild of Danny, a passionate lover of Japanese food. He took a leap of faith and opened his doors to sushi, curry and ramen enthusiasts in early 2021. With a dream in his heart and an appetite for success, Danny’s Diner began its journey.

But like any aspiring entrepreneur, Danny soon realized that running a restaurant involves more than just serving mouthwatering dishes. It requires a deep understanding of customers, their preferences and their patterns of behavior. This realization led him to embark on a new venture – harnessing the power of data to elevate his customer’s dining experience.

Problem Statement
Danny is eager to leverage the data collected during the first few months of operation to unravel key insights about his customers. He yearns to uncover their visiting patterns, discover how much they spend and identify their favourite menu items. Armed with this knowledge, Danny believes he can deliver a personalized experience that will keep his loyal customers coming back for more.

Additionally, Danny wishes to utilize these insights to make informed decisions about expanding his existing customer loyalty program. However, there’s a challenge. Danny and his team lack the expertise to generate basic datasets and analyze the data without relying on complex SQL queries.

The Datasets
To aid in this case study, Danny has graciously provided us with three vital datasets:

Sales – this dataset holds valuable information about the transactions that take place at Danny’s Diner, including the customer ID, menu items ordered and the order date.
Menu – It encompasses all the delightful culinary creations offered at the restaurant including curry, ramen and sushi. It contains details such as item names, and their prices.
Members – This dataset holds information about when customers joined the beta version of Danny’s loyalty program.
